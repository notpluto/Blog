title: Setting it up

So I was recently introduced to this new medium of writing blogs by [@nnnkit](https://twitter.com/nnnkit). This got me curious and led me to set this site up. Pushing out blogs from your code editors. Nice eh? :)

#### Some of you may wonder what I plan to do with this now?

Well, for starters my aim is to write and publish things I learn or consume on regular basis. It could be about.

- Programming where I am trying to stay afloat, or
- Insights from the books I read and find interesting

Or about the things I'm fond of, say living outdoors, running, mountains et al.

For anyone to whom this may appeal, here is a handy [guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#blockquotes) on markdown to get you started with a Gatsby blog.
